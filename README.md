# Knowledge

### About

I stumbled upon Nikita's wonderful [Wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) and decided to make my own. So I created my Github account and tried to learn everything about coding, which I had no idea before. 

I always feel uneasy when exposing myself to the world. Even though nobody knows who I am in real life, I have a weird habit of deleting old posts, articles, or even old pictures of mine on the internet. I hope this document would last longer. 

I would really appreciate it if you can point out any mistakes or suggestion.
